Code for the ticker counter, volume and percentage change from open to close had help from a tutor, Angel.
Angel also helped walk me through the code for the greatest percent increase and decrease for the ticker and value
The AI assistant helped point me in the right direction for the color code
Codes were compared between a classmate, Mariem Diaz, and I during a study session.
